## Getting Started

## Getting Started
**We recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) to download**;
it provides an easy way to synchronize with the latest changes. If it is
inconvenient to download, or you do not want to sign up, you can use another
Git client (like [Sourcetree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree)) or
just download a ZIP archive.

### ...with GitHub Desktop
1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
2. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join), and sign into GitHub
   Desktop.
3. Click File â†’ Clone Repository; in the dialog box, under URL insert
   `https://github.com/aoo-team/ashes-of-the-old-order`. and clone it into
   `Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`, under your user's Documents
   folder. Start the cloning process by clicking "Clone".
4. Open the new folder using a file explorer. Drag `AOTTO.mod`
   into the `mods` folder.
5. Open up `thelastbastion.mod` (the one that you just dragged into your mods folder) with your favorite text editor and go to line 12. Where you see `USERNAME` in `path="C:/Users/USERNAME/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/ashes-of-the-old-order"`, make sure to change it to your actual Windows username. If you are not using the default location, make sure to specify the exact file location of the `Ashes-Of-The-Old-Order` folder. IMPORTANT: Make sure to follow step 4 exactly for this to work, if the `AOTTO.mod` file is not read by the game, this will not work.
