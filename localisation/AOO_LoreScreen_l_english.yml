 COUNTRY_LORE_SEA:0 "§G-----SEATTLE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC ASSEMBLY-----§!\n\nAfter the disastrous fall-apart of the §BUnited States§! in 2002, it didn't take us long to realize the immense boon the destruction of the old order brought about. Millions in the nation groaned as they lived and toiled under a system of brutal capitalistic oppression. While the old United States promised such things as 'freedom' and 'democracy', it didn't take long to look around and see the suffering workers labelling for non-living wages. Basic rights, such as healthcare and a right to a universal basic income were ridiculed and denied by the fascistic system of oppression. While there were a few brave voices speaking out against this system, they were never given a ample opportunity to plan a restructure society. The fall-apart of the §BUnited States§!, caused by its own greed and imperialistic avarice, gave us a chance to rebuild society anew.\n\nAs the ashes settled, a new vision for a society began to take shape. One built by and for, the people. Of course, people can't just organize themselves, and so it was wisely decided by a council of elected representatives to create a executive power, called the chairperson.\n\nAs we stand ready for the future, §YKshama Sawant§! begins here tenure, accountable to the people and People's Council, she is sure to take our Assembly far. However, there are those revisionists and reactionaries who seek to challenge her rule. Foremost of these is §RMichael DuBois§!, Leader of the §RHardliners faction§!, who seek believe a all-powerful executive is the only way for a truly fair and anti-reactionary society to be built. At the opposite end, §GSamuel Durkhan§! leads the §Greformists§!, who despite the name are nothing more than a pack of reactionaries and libertarian capitalists. Sawant has many challenges ahead, and it remains to be seen what direction our mighty workers shall take.
