 wff.1.t:0 "A New America"
 wff.1.d:0 "The New America is one in shambles, the Second American Civil War has left the country in ruins. The modern Americas resemble little of the superpowers they represented during World War II and the Cold War.But hope is not gone yet and we must make sure it does not leave the hearts of our citizens.\n\nIn crises like these, many Presidents collapsed under the pressure, but there is one President that stands out from the rest, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He inspired the American people in a time where hope was limited, so we will attempt to mimic that. We will restart the State of the Union speech to the people and we will remake FDR's signature fireside chat.\n\nThere is still hope in the Americas, we just have to find it."
 wff.1.a:0 "As long is hope is alive, so are we."

 wff.2.t:0 "The Status Quo"
 wff.2.d:0 "The United States is undoubtedly in a runined state, a shell of its former self and outside nations make no efforts not to exclaim that. Although to the American people we are still alive, we are still the hope of a better future that the colonists in 1776 dreamt about. Our ownly problem is that we lack the support of the American people to remake America.\n\nThe will of the American people has been broken, and our job will be to build it back up. Without the support of the people, the United States is nothing. So we are again seeking inspiration from previous Presidents, John F. Kennedy. He inspired the American people in a way that most Presidents never had. But the one part of his presidency that stood out was in one of his speeches where he exclaimed to the American people, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.'\n\nThis will be the dawn of a new era in our history and whether for the better or for the worse, the American people will persist."
 wff.2.a:0 "A future left uncertain."

 wff.3.t:0 "The Northern Revolt"
 wff.3.d:0 "Reports from the Northern territories suggest that the insurgent movements are increasing and they have laid siege to the City of St. Helena. This is no regular protest, to them it is a full scale revolution. If we don't act soon, it is clear that we will lose another piece of American liberty and freedom to the increasing wave of rebels and bandits. May god help us all."
 wff.3.a:0 "The only option is to respond with force."
 wff.3.b:0 "They will listen to reason, we will negotiate."

 wff.4.t:0 "The Next Chapter"
 wff.4.d:0 "There is only one way forward, and it is conquest. The American people have been ununited for too long, and they long to be one nation again. But many of these people are still being oppressed under regimes such as those in the territories to the South or the Northwest of us. President Milley is sure of only one thing, and that is that the United State will expand and that it will be through force. He quotes 'They have sparked the fire of their so-called revolutions. Well, we are the ever-blazing fire of freedom and liberty. And we shall do just that. Fight fire with fire.'"
 wff.4.a:0 "The time has come, to rejoin the Union brothers."
