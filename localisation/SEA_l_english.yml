 SEA_Socialist_Outlook:0 "Socialist Outlook"
 SEA_Socialist_Outlook_desc:0 "Seattle's people are united behind the banner of democratic socialism, having thrown off the shackles of capitalist coporations and successfully nationalising most of the industries of our great city. But many §Wfactions§! divide our party. There are the §GReformists§!, who want a more libertarian model of government, the §OModerates§! who seek to continue the policies of Sawant, and the §RHardliners§!, who seek a more Leninist interpratation of socialism.\n\nThe contentment of the §GReformists§! is: ([?SEA.reformist_contentment|-0])\n\nThe contentment of the §OModerates§! is: ([?SEA.moderate_contentment|-0])\n\nThe contentment of the §RHardliners§! is: ([?SEA.hardliner_contentment|-0])"
 SEA_Problem_Autonomous_Zones:0 "The Problem of the Autonomous Zones"
 SEA_Problem_Autonomous_Zones:0 "While we pride ourselves on the freedom of the working man, there are many, particularly amongst the more §Greform-mindeded§!, believe that the true socialism is not to be found in our People's Council, or in the rule of our Chairman. They believe that the masses must create their own governments and collectives based on communal living. They reject any authority, including our own. We must address this issue, as many of these so-called 'Autonomous Zones' are springing up and are beginning to challenge our capacity to govern (in the interests of the people of course)."

 # Events
 SEA.1.t:0 "A Seattle Commute"
 SEA.1.d:0 "The rain had never poured harder that it did that morning as Kshama Sawant got into her car and began to drive to the People's City Hall. The former software engineer thought over the long road that had lead from Pune, India to the halls of power in Seattle People's Council. She remembered foundly running about the streets of Pune, with the equestrian statue of Peshwa Baji Rao I, hero of the Marathas, with his fierce moustache and countenance, poised to strike the invader. She recalled the tragic day news of her father's death at the hands of a drunk driver reached her family, the tears of her and her mother as they contemplated a difficult future. She remembered the pride she had upon completing her bachelors in computer science at the University of Mumbai, and the fellowship the student union she had joined gave her. Though she aspired to be a programmer, politics began to attract her interest when a student approached her with the writings of a man she had only heard of in her history books...Karl Marx. She remembered reading of Marx, of Lenin, with his firey oratory, and of Trotsky, the man who the revolution betrayed. And now here she was, a woman who had immigrated to America only a year before the fateful day the world came to and end.\n\nAnd yet, in spite of all that, she was a survivor. She had joined a revolutionary group that promised to finally bring the true socialist utopia, here in Free Seattle. She parked her car. The rain had stopped."
 SEA.1.a:0 "There are two days in the year that we can not do anything, yesterday and tomorrow"
 SEA.2.t:0 "A Day in the Life of Mr. Smith"
 SEA.2.d:0 "Michael Jay Smith was a ordinary Seatillite. He worked at a generic mega-corporation, one of many which dotted the city. He worked in a non-descript cubicle which looked exactly like the one before it and the one after it. His boss had uncermouniously asked him if he was willing to work Saturday and Sunday again. The joke of it was, there never was a time that Michael said no, as much as he hated working weekends with every fiber of his being. His boss had a way of making it seem 'voluntary' but the burden of saying 'no' was so great that he always muttered a non-commital 'sure, boss.' He hated that so much. He hated himself for being too cowardly to stand up to the coporate machine, as every day the mighty cogs of the machine ground him down and ate away at his soul a little more. He picked up his jacket. He'd leave early today at least. He had that much freedom."
 SEA.2.a:0 "This is who we are fighting for."
