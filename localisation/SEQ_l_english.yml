 SEQ_Legacy_Project_Ghost_Wind_desc:0 "Many years ago, before the fall of the United States, a secret group of generals and scientists worked together in the dying days of the republic to create a secret store of confiscated WMDs they planned to use should the world come to a end. While their fate is unknown, we happened to come across the store of chemical weapons deep within the Broken Arrow compound. The compound is vast, and we can send out §Yscavenging missions§! to find more WMDs. These can be used against our enemies, and provide large §Gbonuses§! against the survivialists we §Yfight§! or §Yraid§!. However the stock of WMDs is not endless so we should use them wisely. \n\n Our stock of §CSarin Gas§! is: [?SEQ.seq_sarin_gas|-0] units\n\n Our stock of §OVX Gas§! is: [?SEQ.seq_vx_gas|-0] units.\n\nWe suspect that the remaining stock of WMDs in Broken Arrow is: [ROOT.SEQ_GetBrokenArrowStock]"
